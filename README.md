# Unearthed Obsidian Plugin (Kindle Sync)

Unearthed.app is a free service that seamlessly syncs your Kindle highlights and notes to your preferred platforms. 

Currently, we support syncing with:
- **Obsidian** (via this plugin)
- **Notion**
- **Capacities**
- And, of course, the **Unearthed** app itself.

**Important**: Only the books visible in your Kindle notebook at [Amazon Kindle Notebook](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) will be synced.

We're excited to expand support to more sources and offer additional integrations in the future.

The **Daily Reflection** feature will also be added to this Obsidian plugin at some point.

## How to Sync Your Kindle Books with Obsidian

1. Create an account on [unearthed.app](https://unearthed.app).
2. Follow the prompts to sync your Kindle data to Unearthed (this step requires installing a browser extension).
3. Install the Unearthed plugin in your Obsidian vault.
4. Generate an API key from Unearthed (be sure to copy it immediately).
5. Open the plugin settings in Obsidian and paste in your API key, then press "Sync."
6. You can set it to auto-sync each time Obsidian loads, or choose to sync manually from the side panel or the plugin settings.

Unearthed.app, the browser extension, and the Obsidian plugin are all **open source**. We welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community. If you'd like to get involved, check out our repositories and feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
