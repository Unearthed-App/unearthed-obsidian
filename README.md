# Unearthed Obsidian Plugin (Kindle/KOReader Sync)

Unearthed.app is a free service that seamlessly syncs your Kindle (& KOReader) highlights and notes (all of them) to your preferred platforms.
A **Daily Reflection** is served to you that consists of a quote, your note, book, author and location. This plugin allows you to use custom templates to determine how books will appear in Obsidian. It is smart enough to know what quotes/highlights exist already and just append those that are needed.

Currently, Unearthed supports receiving books from:

-   **Kindle**
-   **KOReader**
-   **Unearthed.app** - file import and/or manual creation

and sending books to:

-   **Obsidian** (via this plugin)
-   **Notion**
-   **Capacities**
-   **Supernotes**
-   And, of course, the **Unearthed** app itself.


## Kindle
Auto Kindle sync is free and without limits. For Kindle books, only the books visible in your Kindle notebook at [Amazon Kindle Notebook](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) will be synced.

## KOReader
Highlights and notes made in the KOReader app can now also be sent to Unearthed, adn therefore Obsidian. These highlights will be merged with those from Kindle along with highlights created manually within Unearthed. If you have the same book in both Kindle and KOReader, the highlights will be merged to the same book so that when it appears in Obsidian, all the highlights are within the same book file. KOReader integration is limited to **Premium** users.

## Tags

Unearthed.app now has a comprehensive solution for tagging highlights and notes. You can do this manually (and quickly via inline highlighting text) or you can let AI help you tag and extract ideas. Within unearthed.app you will be able to see a graph view of all of your books, highlights, and tags connected together. These tags will be sent to your Obsidian vault as well, allowing you to connect your ideas together and keep them offline. Tag files will automatically be created in Obsidian and linked to your books. This is limited to **Premium** users.
